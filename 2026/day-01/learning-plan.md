# 90 Days DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## Introduction

I am a **working IT professional (4+ years experience)** currently working in automation and infrastructure-related roles.  
I have hands-on exposure to scripting, CI/CD concepts, Linux, cloud basics, and production systems, but I want to **transition fully into a confident, end-to-end DevOps Engineer role** with strong execution and troubleshooting skills.

DevOps, to me, is not just tools—it is about **ownership, automation, reliability, and continuous improvement**.  
Cloud engineering enables DevOps by providing scalable, resilient, and programmable infrastructure.

This 90-day plan is my **execution blueprint**, not a theoretical roadmap.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud

- To move from tool-based knowledge to **real-world production readiness**
- To confidently design, deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot systems
- To grow into a **responsible DevOps engineer who can own systems end-to-end**
- To accelerate my career growth in cloud-native and platform engineering roles

---

## Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days

By the end of 90 days, I want to:

1. **Deploy a production-grade application on Kubernetes** with CI/CD, monitoring, and logging  
2. **Design and implement complete CI/CD pipelines** using Git, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes  
3. **Troubleshoot Linux, containers, and Kubernetes issues confidently**, like a real on-call DevOps engineer

## Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

1. **Linux & System Troubleshooting**
   - Processes, networking, logs, performance, permissions

2. **CI/CD & Automation**
   - Git, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, Docker, pipeline design, failure handling

3. **Kubernetes & Cloud-Native Operations**
   - Kubernetes architecture, deployments, services, debugging, monitoring

---

## Weekly Time Commitment

- **Weekdays:** 2–2.5 hours per day  
- **Weekends:** 4–6 hours per day  
- **Total:** ~18–20 hours per week  

Time will be split between:
- Learning concepts
- Hands-on labs
- Debugging & failure analysis
- Revision & documentation

---

## How I Will Stay Consistent

- Daily learning, even if small (minimum 1 hour rule)
- Focus on **hands-on execution over over-research**
- Maintain notes and labs in GitHub
- Learn in public through LinkedIn updates
- Treat this plan like a **job responsibility, not a hobby**

---

## Final Commitment

I understand that DevOps mastery comes from **discipline, consistency, and real execution**.  
This 90-day journey is my commitment to becoming a **reliable, production-ready DevOps Engineer**.

I will show up every day and do the work.
